How to play:
1. Run the server using Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10, open the "server.sln" file
	a. In order to  change the type of latency, go to "main.cpp" and look for the line "int latencyType = 0;" (line 29) and change the number. (0 = fixed, 1 = incremental, 2 = random)

2. Run the client, "pong.html", on a browser. We used Google Chrome.
3. On the client side, enter the Server IP, Server Port, and a User ID
4. Click "Connect" , then click "Start"
5. The game will not start until all 4 players have clicked "Start"
